the action allowed only: sa, ra, pa.
	At first, stack A has value, we compare the position i with i++ and the last position.
	We move the minimum to position i, copy it to stack B, move the pointer to the second one and continue to do it.
	When the stack B has 3 value. Start to sort it to make sure the maximum in the last position.
	The loop will stop until the pointer reach the end of stack - 2. Just did the sort for the last one.
	- The memory of stack b will be argc - 3. 
	- Find the minimum, maximum in 3 number. 
	- Move the minimum to the top, maximum the last, the remain to the next top for stack A.
	- Move the minimum to the last, maximum the top, the main to the next last for stack B.
